Description: The causal decompositions of group disparities developed by
    Yu and Elwert (2023). This package implements the estimators for the
    decomposition components that are based on efficient influence
    functions. For the nuisance functions of the estimators, parametric
    and nonparametric options are both provided, as well as manual options
    in case the default models are not satisfying.
