Description: The causal decompositions of group disparities developed by
    Yu and Elwert (2023)
    <https://ang-yu.github.io/files/Causal_Decomposition_of_Group_Disparities_2023.pdf>.
    This package implements the estimators for the decomposition
    components that are based on efficient influence functions. For the
    nuisance functions of the estimators, both parametric and
    nonparametric options are provided, as well as manual options in case
    the default models are not satisfying.
